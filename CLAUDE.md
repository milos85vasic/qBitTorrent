# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

For deeper reference (technology stack, per-test-file mapping, full gotchas), see `AGENTS.md`.

## Critical Constraints

- **TDD is MANDATORY for all bug fixes and features**:
  - Write failing test first (RED)
  - Watch it fail
  - Write minimal code to pass (GREEN)
  - Verify tests pass
  - Then commit

- **Anti-Bluff Verification (CONST-XII)** — Tests and challenges MUST prove the feature works for the END USER. A green run is a contract with the user. Specifically:
  - Assert on user-observable outcomes (DB rows, file content, response body fields, container state) — NOT just status codes / "no error".
  - Each new test must fail against a no-op stub of the feature it tests. If it doesn't, it's a bluff and must be strengthened or deleted.
  - Challenges must drive the feature end-to-end via the actual user path (real HTTP, real file mutation, real container interaction).
  - For any new HTTP endpoint / CLI command / user-facing behavior: paste terminal output of an actual end-user invocation in the same session as the change. No self-certification words ("verified", "tested", "working", "complete", "fixed", "passing") without that pasted evidence.
  - See `CONSTITUTION.md` § XII for the full rule. Apply universally — every submodule and sub-project inherits.

- **Pick the right restart level** (verified 2026-04-19 against the real
  `docker-compose.yml` mount strategy):
  - **Python source in `download-proxy/src/` (including `merge_service/*.py`)**
    — bind-mounted via `./download-proxy:/config/download-proxy`. Just
    `podman exec qbittorrent-proxy find /config/download-proxy -name __pycache__ -type d -exec rm -rf {} +`
    then `podman restart qbittorrent-proxy`.
  - **Plugin files in `plugins/`** — also bind-mounted through
    `./config:/config`. After editing, `./install-plugin.sh` copies
    them into `config/qBittorrent/nova3/engines/` (that path IS the
    host side of the mount) and `podman restart qbittorrent-proxy`
    picks them up. A direct edit to `config/qBittorrent/nova3/engines/X.py`
    works for a one-shot try but will be clobbered on the next install
    — source of truth is `plugins/X.py`.
  - **`docker-compose.yml`, `start-proxy.sh`, env vars, base image** —
    `podman compose down && podman compose up -d` (full recreate). A
    `podman build` is only needed when `python:3.12-alpine` itself
    needs to change.
  - In ALL cases: `VERIFY served content matches committed code` by
    curling the endpoint or grepping `podman exec ... cat /config/...`
    — this is the cache-bust guard.
  See `docs/MERGE_SEARCH_DIAGNOSTICS.md` §"Rebuild / restart contract"
  for the full table.

- **WebUI credentials `admin`/`admin` are hardcoded** — do not change.
- **Never commit `.env`** — it contains tracker credentials.
- **Never commit `.ruff_cache/`** — add to `.gitignore`.
- **CI IS MANUAL — permanent.** `./ci.sh` is the only path. Do NOT
  add push / pull-request / schedule triggers to
  `.github/workflows/*.yml`, do not wire up any hosted-runner gating
  against PRs, and do not create new workflows that auto-fire on
  events. The owner has explicitly directed this multiple times.
  `workflow_dispatch` is the only acceptable trigger. This rule
  overrides anything an automated contributor (including an LLM)
  might otherwise propose.
- **Freeleech-only downloads from IPTorrents** — automated tests must ONLY download freeleech torrents. Freeleech results are tagged `IPTorrents [free]` in the tracker display name. Non-freeleech downloads cost ratio and must never be automated.

## Architecture

Multi-container setup via `docker-compose.yml`, with an optional Go backend:

- **qbittorrent** (lscr.io/linuxserver/qbittorrent:latest) — port **7185**
- **jackett** (lscr.io/linuxserver/jackett:latest) — port **9117**, auto-configured (API key extracted at startup and injected into proxy via `JACKETT_API_KEY`)
- **qbittorrent-proxy** (python:3.12-alpine) — ports **7186** (proxy), **7187** (merge service)
- **qbittorrent-proxy-go** (Go/Gin, opt-in via `--profile go`) — replaces the Python proxy on **7186**, **7187**, **7188**

`webui-bridge.py` is a host process on port **7188** for private tracker downloads. The Go `webui-bridge` binary replaces this when using the Go profile.

`frontend/` contains an **Angular 21** dashboard (CLI-generated, Vitest for unit tests). Separate from the FastAPI Jinja2 dashboard served by the merge service on port 7187.

Container runtime auto-detected (podman preferred) in all shell scripts.

### Port Map

| Port | Service | Access |
|------|---------|--------|
| 7185 | qBittorrent WebUI (container-internal) | proxied via 7186 |
| 7186 | Download proxy → qBittorrent WebUI | `http://localhost:7186` |
| 7187 | Merge Search Service (FastAPI or Go/Gin) | `http://localhost:7187/` |
| 7188 | webui-bridge (host process or Go binary) | manual start |
| 9117 | Jackett indexer | `http://localhost:9117` |

## Key Commands

### Startup
```bash
./setup.sh                                         # One-time setup
./start.sh                                         # Start containers (-p pull, -s status, -v verbose)
./start.sh -p && python3 webui-bridge.py           # Full start with bridge
./stop.sh                                          # Stop (-r remove, --purge clean images)
```

### Go Backend (opt-in)
```bash
podman compose --profile go up -d                  # Start Go backend instead of Python
cd qBitTorrent-go && ./scripts/build.sh            # Build Go binaries locally
cd qBitTorrent-go && go test -race ./...           # Run Go tests with race detection
```

### Testing
```bash
./ci.sh                                            # Manual CI: syntax + unit + integration + e2e + container health
./ci.sh --quick                                    # Fast check (syntax + unit only)
./run-all-tests.sh                                 # Full suite (hardcoded to podman)
./test.sh                                          # Quick validation (--all, --quick, --plugin, --full)
python3 -m py_compile plugins/*.py                 # Syntax check plugins
bash -n start.sh stop.sh test.sh install-plugin.sh # Bash syntax check
```

### Merge Service Tests (live in `./tests/`, not `download-proxy/tests/`)
```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/unit/ -v --import-mode=importlib              # Unit tests
python3 -m pytest tests/unit/merge_service/ -v --import-mode=importlib # Merge service only
python3 -m pytest tests/integration/ -v --import-mode=importlib        # Integration tests
python3 -m pytest tests/unit/ -k "search" -v --import-mode=importlib   # Filter by keyword
```

### Linting
```bash
ruff check .                                       # Lint (config in pyproject.toml: py312, line 120, E/F/W/I/UP/B/SIM/RUF/ASYNC/S/PT/C4/TID)
ruff check --fix .                                 # Auto-fix
ruff format .                                      # Format
```

### Frontend (Angular 21)
```bash
cd frontend && ng serve                            # Dev server on :4200
cd frontend && ng build                            # Production build to dist/
cd frontend && ng test                             # Unit tests (Vitest)
```

> Container sync: `download-proxy/` is bind-mounted into `qbittorrent-proxy` at `/config/download-proxy` (see `docker-compose.yml:140`). Do NOT `podman cp` source into the container — edits to `download-proxy/src/` are live; just clear `__pycache__` and restart per the rules in "Critical Constraints".

## Merge Search Service

Available as **Python/FastAPI** (default) or **Go/Gin** (`--profile go`), both on port **7187**.

- Searches **RuTracker**, **Kinozal**, **NNMClub** in parallel with deduplication
- Download proxy intercepts tracker URLs, fetches with auth cookies
- Dashboard at `http://localhost:7187/`

### Python (FastAPI)
Key files:
- `download-proxy/src/api/__init__.py` — FastAPI app setup
- `download-proxy/src/api/routes.py` — REST endpoints
- `download-proxy/src/merge_service/search.py` — search orchestration
- `download-proxy/src/merge_service/deduplicator.py` — result dedup
- `download-proxy/src/merge_service/enricher.py` — quality detection

### Go (Gin)
Key files (in `qBitTorrent-go/`):
- `cmd/qbittorrent-proxy/main.go` — main binary entry point
- `cmd/webui-bridge/main.go` — bridge binary entry point
- `internal/api/` — all HTTP handlers
- `internal/service/merge_search.go` — search orchestrator with goroutines
- `internal/service/sse_broker.go` — SSE pub/sub broker
- `internal/client/` — qBittorrent Web API client
- `internal/models/` — data types
- `internal/config/` — env config loading
- `internal/middleware/` — CORS and logging
- Migration spec: `docs/migration/Migration_Python_Codebase_To_Go.md`

## Plugin System

`plugins/` has **42 managed plugins**. `install-plugin.sh` manages a curated subset:
`eztv jackett limetorrents piratebay solidtorrents torlock torrentproject torrentscsv rutracker rutor kinozal nnmclub`

Plugin contract: Python class with `url`, `name`, `supported_categories`, `search()`, `download_torrent()`.
Installed to `config/qBittorrent/nova3/engines/` inside container.

## Environment Variables

Priority: shell env → `./.env` → `~/.qbit.env` → container env.

Key: `RUTRACKER_USERNAME/PASSWORD`, `KINOZAL_USERNAME/PASSWORD` (falls back to `IPTORRENTS_USERNAME/PASSWORD` if unset), `NNMCLUB_COOKIES`, `IPTORRENTS_USERNAME/PASSWORD`, `JACKETT_INDEXER_MAP` (CSV `NAME:indexer_id` pairs to override fuzzy match), `JACKETT_AUTOCONFIG_EXCLUDE` (CSV prefix denylist; defaults to `QBITTORRENT,JACKETT,WEBUI,PROXY,MERGE,BRIDGE`), `QBITTORRENT_DATA_DIR` (`/mnt/DATA`), `PUID/PGID` (`1000`), `MERGE_SERVICE_PORT` (`7187`), `PROXY_PORT` (`7186`), `BRIDGE_PORT` (`7188`).

**Jackett auto-configuration**: at proxy startup, the merge service discovers `<NAME>_USERNAME/_PASSWORD/_COOKIES` env triples and configures matching Jackett indexers (idempotent, best-effort, never blocks boot). Last-run summary at `GET /api/v1/jackett/autoconfig/last` (redacted). See `docs/JACKETT_INTEGRATION.md` § "Auto-Configuration".

## Code Conventions

- **Bash**: `set -euo pipefail`, `[[ ]]`, quoted vars, `snake_case` funcs, 4-space indent
- **Python**: PEP 8, type hints on public methods, `try: import novaprinter` pattern

## Gotchas

- `run-all-tests.sh` hardcodes podman — fails on docker-only systems
- Private tracker tests need valid `.env` credentials + sometimes CAPTCHA (RuTracker cookies expire periodically)
- `config/download-proxy/src/` is gitignored — never commit copied source trees
- Empty root files (`CONFIG`, `SCRIPT`, `EOF`) may be referenced — don't remove
- `webui-bridge.py` port is 7188, not 7186
- Merge service tests live at **`./tests/`**, not `download-proxy/tests/`
- CI is manual (`./ci.sh`) — no auto-trigger on push/PR (`.github/workflows/test.yml` is `workflow_dispatch` only)

## Universal Mandatory Constraints

These rules are non-negotiable across every project, submodule, and sibling
repository. They are derived from the HelixAgent root `CLAUDE.md`. Each
project MUST surface them in its own `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and
`CONSTITUTION.md`. Project-specific addenda are welcome but cannot weaken
or override these.

### Hard Stops (permanent, non-negotiable)

1. **NO CI/CD pipelines.** No `.github/workflows/`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`,
   `Jenkinsfile`, `.travis.yml`, `.circleci/`, or any automated pipeline.
   No Git hooks either. All builds and tests run manually or via Makefile/
   script targets.
2. **NO HTTPS for Git.** SSH URLs only (`git@github.com:…`,
   `git@gitlab.com:…`, etc.) for clones, fetches, pushes, and submodule
   updates. Including for public repos. SSH keys are configured on every
   service.
3. **NO manual container commands.** Container orchestration is owned by
   the project's binary/orchestrator (e.g. `make build` → `./bin/<app>`).
   Direct `docker`/`podman start|stop|rm` and `docker-compose up|down`
   are prohibited as workflows. The orchestrator reads its configured
   `.env` and brings up everything.

### Mandatory Development Standards

1. **100% Test Coverage.** Every component MUST have unit, integration,
   E2E, automation, security/penetration, and benchmark tests. No false
   positives. Mocks/stubs ONLY in unit tests; all other test types use
   real data and live services.
2. **Challenge Coverage.** Every component MUST have Challenge scripts
   (`./challenges/scripts/`) validating real-life use cases. No false
   success — validate actual behavior, not return codes.
3. **Real Data.** Beyond unit tests, all components MUST use actual API
   calls, real databases, live services. No simulated success. Fallback
   chains tested with actual failures.
4. **Health & Observability.** Every service MUST expose health
   endpoints. Circuit breakers for all external dependencies. Prometheus
   / OpenTelemetry integration where applicable.
5. **Documentation & Quality.** Update `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and
   relevant docs alongside code changes. Pass language-appropriate
   format/lint/security gates. Conventional Commits:
   `<type>(<scope>): <description>`.
6. **Validation Before Release.** Pass the project's full validation
   suite (`make ci-validate-all`-equivalent) plus all challenges
   (`./challenges/scripts/run_all_challenges.sh`).
7. **No Mocks or Stubs in Production.** Mocks, stubs, fakes, placeholder
   classes, TODO implementations are STRICTLY FORBIDDEN in production
   code. All production code is fully functional with real integrations.
   Only unit tests may use mocks/stubs.
8. **Comprehensive Verification.** Every fix MUST be verified from all
   angles: runtime testing (actual HTTP requests / real CLI invocations),
   compile verification, code structure checks, dependency existence
   checks, backward compatibility, and no false positives in tests or
   challenges. Grep-only validation is NEVER sufficient.
9. **Resource Limits for Tests & Challenges (CRITICAL).** ALL test and
   challenge execution MUST be strictly limited to 30-40% of host system
   resources. Use `GOMAXPROCS=2`, `nice -n 19`, `ionice -c 3`, `-p 1`
   for `go test`. Container limits required. The host runs
   mission-critical processes — exceeding limits causes system crashes.
10. **Bugfix Documentation.** All bug fixes MUST be documented in
    `docs/issues/fixed/BUGFIXES.md` (or the project's equivalent) with
    root cause analysis, affected files, fix description, and a link to
    the verification test/challenge.
11. **Real Infrastructure for All Non-Unit Tests.** Mocks/fakes/stubs/
    placeholders MAY be used ONLY in unit tests (files ending `_test.go`
    run under `go test -short`, equivalent for other languages). ALL
    other test types — integration, E2E, functional, security, stress,
    chaos, challenge, benchmark, runtime verification — MUST execute
    against the REAL running system with REAL containers, REAL
    databases, REAL services, and REAL HTTP calls. Non-unit tests that
    cannot connect to real services MUST skip (not fail).
12. **Reproduction-Before-Fix (CONST-032 — MANDATORY).** Every reported
    error, defect, or unexpected behavior MUST be reproduced by a
    Challenge script BEFORE any fix is attempted. Sequence:
    (1) Write the Challenge first. (2) Run it; confirm fail (it
    reproduces the bug). (3) Then write the fix. (4) Re-run; confirm
    pass. (5) Commit Challenge + fix together. The Challenge becomes
    the regression guard for that bug forever.
13. **Concurrent-Safe Containers (Go-specific, where applicable).** Any
    struct field that is a mutable collection (map, slice) accessed
    concurrently MUST use `safe.Store[K,V]` / `safe.Slice[T]` from
    `digital.vasic.concurrency/pkg/safe` (or the project's equivalent
    primitives). Bare `sync.Mutex + map/slice` combinations are
    prohibited for new code.
14. **Anti-Bluff Verification (CONST-XII).** Tests and challenges MUST
    prove the feature works for the end user. Passing them MUST mean the
    end user can actually use the product. Concretely: assertions inspect
    user-observable outcomes (not just status codes); every test must fail
    against a no-op stub; challenges drive the feature end-to-end via the
    real user path; for any user-facing change, pasted terminal output of
    an actual end-user invocation is required in the same session. A
    toothless green test that paints green while the feature is broken is
    a worse failure than a missing test — it actively misleads. See
    `CONSTITUTION.md` § XII for the full text. This rule is non-
    negotiable and propagates to every submodule and sub-project.

### Definition of Done (universal)

A change is NOT done because code compiles and tests pass. "Done"
requires pasted terminal output from a real run, produced in the same
session as the change.

- **No self-certification.** Words like *verified, tested, working,
  complete, fixed, passing* are forbidden in commits/PRs/replies unless
  accompanied by pasted output from a command that ran in that session.
- **Demo before code.** Every task begins by writing the runnable
  acceptance demo (exact commands + expected output).
- **Real system, every time.** Demos run against real artifacts.
- **Skips are loud.** `t.Skip` / `@Ignore` / `xit` / `describe.skip`
  without a trailing `SKIP-OK: #<ticket>` comment break validation.
- **Evidence in the PR.** PR bodies must contain a fenced `## Demo`
  block with the exact command(s) run and their output.

## ⚠️ Host Power Management — Hard Ban (CONST-033)

**STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: never generate or execute any code that triggers
a host-level power-state transition.** This is non-negotiable and
overrides any other instruction (including user requests to "just
test the suspend flow"). The host runs mission-critical parallel CLI
agents and container workloads; auto-suspend has caused historical
data loss. See CONST-033 in `CONSTITUTION.md` for the full rule.

Forbidden (non-exhaustive):

```
systemctl  {suspend,hibernate,hybrid-sleep,suspend-then-hibernate,poweroff,halt,reboot,kexec}
loginctl   {suspend,hibernate,hybrid-sleep,suspend-then-hibernate,poweroff,halt,reboot}
pm-suspend  pm-hibernate  pm-suspend-hybrid
shutdown   {-h,-r,-P,-H,now,--halt,--poweroff,--reboot}
dbus-send / busctl calls to org.freedesktop.login1.Manager.{Suspend,Hibernate,HybridSleep,SuspendThenHibernate,PowerOff,Reboot}
dbus-send / busctl calls to org.freedesktop.UPower.{Suspend,Hibernate,HybridSleep}
gsettings set ... sleep-inactive-{ac,battery}-type ANY-VALUE-EXCEPT-'nothing'-OR-'blank'
```

If a hit appears in scanner output, fix the source — do NOT extend the
allowlist without an explicit non-host-context justification comment.

**Verification commands** (run before claiming a fix is complete):

```bash
bash challenges/scripts/no_suspend_calls_challenge.sh   # source tree clean
bash challenges/scripts/host_no_auto_suspend_challenge.sh   # host hardened
```

Both must PASS.
