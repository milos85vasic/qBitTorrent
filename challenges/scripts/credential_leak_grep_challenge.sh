# EXPECT: TestNoCredentialLeak under the security build tag completes
# with "PASS" — all four leak channels (logs, response bodies,
# /proc/self/environ, DB hex) reject every seeded plaintext, AND wrong-
# key decryption fails for every row.
#
# CONST-XII anti-bluff: a no-op redactor would put plaintext into the
# captured log buffer; a stub Encrypt would leave plaintext in the DB
# file; either failure surfaces here as a Go test failure (non-zero
# exit), and this script forwards that exit code.
#
# Pass: PASS message + exit 0
# Fail: FAIL: <reason> + exit 1
