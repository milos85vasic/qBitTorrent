# Testing Guide

This is the **authoritative test-type catalogue** for qBittorrent-Fixed.
Every testable module in the repo must have coverage in every applicable
row below. The catalogue is derived from Part C of the
completion-initiative plan (`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-19-completion-initiative.md`).

Rows marked *pending* are scaffolded by the completion-initiative plan
phases (see the plan document for the phase that ships each one).

## Where tests live

- **Top-level `tests/`** — all merge-service tests, *not*
  `download-proxy/tests/` (which does not exist).
- **`frontend/src/**/*.spec.ts`** — co-located Angular unit tests.
- **CI jobs** — `.github/workflows/{syntax,unit,integration,nightly,security}.yml`.

## Service-availability fixtures

Since Phase 0 the following fixtures **start the compose stack** rather
than skip when services are down (converted 71 runtime skips to
fixture-gated executions, per commit `55d29ce`):

| Fixture | Starts | Asserts |
|---|---|---|
| `merge_service_live` | `qbittorrent-proxy` | `GET http://localhost:7187/health` → 200 |
| `qbittorrent_live` | `qbittorrent` | `GET http://localhost:7186/` → 200 |
| `webui_bridge_live` | `webui-bridge.py` | `GET http://localhost:7188/health` → 200 |
| `all_services_live` | all three | all of the above |

Defined in `tests/fixtures/services.py` and wired into
`tests/conftest.py`.

## How to add a new test (TDD cadence)

The CLAUDE.md critical constraint is non-negotiable:

1. **RED** — write the failing test first. Name it after the behaviour,
   not the implementation. Put it in the directory that matches the
   test type from the catalogue above.
2. **Watch it fail** — run the test in isolation
   (`pytest tests/unit/test_new_thing.py::test_specific_case -v`) and
   confirm the failure reason is the one you want
   (NOT an import error, NOT a fixture error).
3. **GREEN** — write the minimum production code to make the test pass.
   No refactors yet.
4. **Verify** — run the whole affected test directory to prove nothing
   else regressed.
5. **Rebuild-reboot** — if the change touched container code, follow the
   CLAUDE.md REBUILD AND REBOOT constraint:
   ```bash
   ./stop.sh
   podman exec qbittorrent-proxy find / -name __pycache__ -type d -exec rm -rf {} + || true
   ./start.sh -p
   ```
   Curl-check the served content matches the committed code.
6. **Commit** — one behaviour per commit. Commit message follows
   `<type>(phase-N): <subject>` when part of a phased plan.

## Coverage gate

- `pyproject.toml` contains `[tool.coverage.report]` with
  `fail_under` set to the current gate (Phase 0 starts low;
  Phase 5 raises it module-by-module to 100 %).
- The baseline zero point is captured in
  [`COVERAGE_BASELINE.md`](COVERAGE_BASELINE.md).
- HTML reports land in `htmlcov/`; XML (for SonarQube) in `coverage.xml`.

## CI entry points

- **Local full pipeline** — `./ci.sh`
- **Quick loop** — `./ci.sh --quick`
- **Hardcoded-podman runner** — `./run-all-tests.sh` (note: hardcodes
  podman, will fail on docker-only systems — see CLAUDE.md gotcha)
- **Single-file** — `./test.sh --plugin <name>` or
  `./test.sh --full`

## Per-tracker search stats

Tests that cover `TrackerSearchStat` and the `tracker_started` /
`tracker_completed` SSE events live across four suites:

| Test file | Type | What it pins |
|---|---|---|
| `tests/unit/merge_service/test_tracker_stats.py` | Unit | `TrackerSearchStat` defaults, status transitions (pending → running → success / empty / error / timeout), `duration_ms` bookkeeping, auth-flag provenance, and sorted `to_dict()` serialisation. |
| `tests/unit/api_layer/test_tracker_stats_sse.py` | Unit (streaming) | The SSE poll loop emits `tracker_started` exactly once on pending→running and `tracker_completed` exactly once per terminal flip; gracefully degrades when metadata predates `tracker_stats`. |
| `tests/property/test_tracker_stats_properties.py` | Property (Hypothesis) | sum of `results_count` == `total_results`, every completed stat has `duration_ms >= 0`, `set(tracker_stats keys) == set(trackers_searched)`, failed trackers retain `error_type` + `error`. |
| `tests/contract/test_tracker_stats_contract.py` | Contract | `POST /api/v1/search`, `POST /api/v1/search/sync`, and `GET /api/v1/search/{id}` all expose the 15-field `tracker_stats` payload on `SearchResponse`. |

The frontend dialog + chip bar are covered by
`frontend/src/app/components/tracker-stat-dialog/tracker-stat-dialog.component.spec.ts`
and the `tracker stats bar` describe block in
`frontend/src/app/components/dashboard/dashboard.component.spec.ts`.

Whenever the `TrackerSearchStat` shape changes, run
`./scripts/freeze-openapi.sh` to refresh `docs/api/openapi.json` so
the contract test `test_frozen_and_live_have_same_schemas` stays green.

## Gotchas

- `pytest` needs `--import-mode=importlib` for the merge service —
  the project is not a Python package (no `__init__.py` at the root).
- Integration tests with `requests.get("http://localhost:7187/").ok`
  guards are **obsolete** since Phase 0 — use the live fixtures
  instead. `tests/unit/test_no_runtime_service_skips.py` enforces this.
- `pytest-timeout` hard-caps every test at 30 seconds. Stress and
  load tests that legitimately run longer must override with
  `@pytest.mark.timeout(...)`.
- The CI workflow is **no longer manual-only** since Phase 0.4 — push
  and PR triggers the syntax / unit / integration workflows. Only the
  `nightly.yml` and `security.yml` are scheduled.
