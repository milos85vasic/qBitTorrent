# Concurrency Model

qBittorrent-Fixed's merge service is an **asyncio-first** FastAPI app
with a small amount of thread-based plumbing for the legacy
download-proxy. This document is the reference for how the pieces fit
together, where the hot spots are, and where the pending hardening
lives.

## The two-thread daemon

`download-proxy/src/main.py` launches two daemon threads in a single
Python process:

```
Thread 1: start_original_proxy()   — legacy HTTP server on :7186
Thread 2: start_fastapi_server()   — uvicorn on :7187, own asyncio loop
Main:     while True: time.sleep(60)
```

The main thread keeps the process alive; `KeyboardInterrupt` logs and
exits. **Graceful shutdown is pending Phase 3** — today a `SIGTERM`
races the two threads and can drop in-flight requests. See
[`architecture/shutdown-sequence.mmd`](architecture/shutdown-sequence.mmd)
for the target sequence.

Reference: `download-proxy/src/main.py:69-83`.

## Search fan-out

The hot path. `SearchOrchestrator.search()` in
`download-proxy/src/merge_service/search.py:270` fans out one coroutine
per tracker:

```python
search_results = await asyncio.gather(*[_search_one(t) for t in trackers])
```

(`search.py:308`).

Characteristics:

- **~40 trackers** run **fully concurrently** today — no Semaphore cap.
- Each `_search_one(t)` stores its results incrementally in
  `self._tracker_results[search_id][tracker.name]` so the SSE stream
  can surface partial results before `gather()` returns.
- `asyncio.gather` propagates exceptions unless each task catches its
  own; the code does catch per-tracker so one failing tracker does
  not abort the merge.

**Pending hardening (Phase 3):**

- Introduce `asyncio.Semaphore(MAX_CONCURRENT_TRACKERS)` — env var
  `MAX_CONCURRENT_TRACKERS`, default **5**. Status: **pending**.
- Wrap each per-tracker coroutine in `tenacity.AsyncRetrying` for
  exponential back-off (currently a failed tracker returns `[]`
  immediately).
- Add `pybreaker.CircuitBreaker` per tracker so a misbehaving tracker
  is fast-failed for a cool-down window instead of slowing the whole
  search on every query.

## Subprocess-based plugin execution

Public trackers run out-of-process via
`asyncio.create_subprocess_exec("python3", "-c", <script>, …)` with a
**10-second hard timeout** (`search.py:407`). The subprocess gets its
own `asyncio.subprocess.Pipe` for stdout/stderr. If it times out:

```python
await asyncio.wait_for(proc.communicate(), timeout=10)
...
if proc and proc.returncode is None:
    proc.kill()
    await proc.wait()
```

Phase 2 replaces this with an in-process `ProcessPoolExecutor` that
keeps one warm worker per tracker and enforces resource limits.

## TTL caches for ephemeral dicts

Several dicts grow unbounded today:

| Dict | File | Growth hazard |
|---|---|---|
| `_active_searches` | `search.py:233` | One entry per search forever |
| `_last_merged_results` | `search.py:235` | One tuple per search forever |
| `_tracker_results` | `search.py:236` | One nested dict per search forever |
| `_tracker_sessions` | `search.py:234` | One entry per authenticated tracker; overwritten, not leaked, but aiohttp sessions never close |
| `_pending_captchas` | `api/auth.py:24` | Grows on every `/captcha` call |
| `_execution_logs` | `api/hooks.py:56` | Capped at 200 via `LOGS_MAX` (good) |
| `streaming seen_hashes` | `api/streaming.py` | Per-SSE-generator set, mutated concurrently |

**Pending hardening (Phase 3):**

- Replace each dict with `cachetools.TTLCache(maxsize=..., ttl=...)`.
- Close `aiohttp.ClientSession` at the end of each tracker search
  (currently reused across calls; at minimum add a `close()` on
  orchestrator shutdown).
- Lock `_execution_logs` append with `asyncio.Lock` — currently a data
  race if two hooks finish concurrently.

## Retry + circuit-breaker

**Today:** zero use of `tenacity`, `backoff`, or `async-timeout`
anywhere in the code. A single request failure surfaces as a zero-result
tracker.

**Phase 3 target:**

- `tenacity.AsyncRetrying` wrapping every outbound HTTP call
  (aiohttp + subprocess). Exponential back-off with jitter, max 3
  attempts.
- `pybreaker.CircuitBreaker` per tracker, opening after 5 consecutive
  failures and closing after a 60 s recovery probe.
- Both pieces share a single `TrackerHealth` dataclass so
  `/api/v1/trackers/health` can expose the current state.

## Streaming (SSE)

`download-proxy/src/api/streaming.py` (222 lines) owns the live
`/api/v1/search/stream/{search_id}` endpoint. Behaviour:

- Each client gets its own generator with a local `seen_hashes: set()`.
- The generator polls `orchestrator.get_live_results(search_id)` in a
  `while True: await asyncio.sleep(0.5)` loop.
- Deduplication happens client-side (`seen_hashes`).
- **Gap:** no disconnect detection — the generator keeps polling even
  after the HTTP client drops. Phase 3 adds a `await request.is_disconnected()`
  check at the top of the loop.

## Graceful shutdown

**Target sequence** (Phase 3 target, not yet implemented):

1. `SIGTERM` received by the container.
2. Signal handler sets a global `_shutting_down` flag.
3. FastAPI rejects new requests (503) and cancels in-flight search
   tasks via a shared `asyncio.Event`.
4. `aiohttp.ClientSession` instances close.
5. `asyncio.Task`s are awaited with a 5 s grace period.
6. Daemon threads are joined with `join(timeout=5)`.
7. Process exits 0.

See [`architecture/shutdown-sequence.mmd`](architecture/shutdown-sequence.mmd)
for the target sequence diagram.

## Concurrency tests

- **Unit** — `tests/unit/test_merge_trackers.py` exercises the
  orchestrator happy path.
- **Performance** — `tests/performance/test_concurrent_search.py`
  benchmarks the gather fan-out.
- **Stress** — `tests/stress/test_search_stress.py` runs the
  orchestrator at elevated load.
- **Benchmarks** — `tests/benchmark/test_search_benchmark.py` and
  `test_deduplication_benchmark.py` track p50/p95 regressions.
- **Pending (Phase 3)** — `tests/concurrency/` uses pytest-randomly +
  pytest-repeat to surface asyncio race conditions.

## Observability hooks

Once the Prometheus/Grafana stack is up (see
[`OBSERVABILITY.md`](OBSERVABILITY.md)), the following metrics surface
the concurrency health:

- `qbit_merge_active_searches` — gauge
- `qbit_merge_tracker_requests_total` — counter, labelled by tracker
- `qbit_merge_search_duration_seconds_bucket` — histogram
- `qbit_merge_circuit_breaker_state` — gauge (0 = closed, 1 = half,
  2 = open), labelled by tracker
