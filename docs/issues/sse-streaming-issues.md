# SSE Streaming Issues — RESOLVED

## Issue Summary

Real-time streaming of search results via Server-Sent Events (SSE) was not working in the browser. The root cause was identified and fixed.

## Root Cause

**Missing double newline in SSE event termination.**

The `SSEHandler.format_event()` method in `download-proxy/src/api/streaming.py` produced events ending with a single `\n`:

```
event: result_found\ndata: {"name": "..."}\n
```

The Server-Sent Events specification requires events to be terminated by **two newline characters** (`\n\n`). Browsers (including Chrome/Yandex) will not dispatch events that are not properly terminated.

## Fix Applied

**File**: `download-proxy/src/api/streaming.py`
**Change**: Added a second empty line to the SSE event format:

```python
lines.append("")  # Empty line terminates event
lines.append("")  # Second newline required by SSE spec
return "\n".join(lines)
```

## Verification

### Backend (curl)
```bash
curl -N "http://localhost:7187/api/v1/search/stream/<search_id>"
```
Events now properly end with `\n\n` and are correctly parsed by browsers.

### Tests
- `tests/unit/test_streaming.py` — Added `TestSSEFormatCompliance` with 3 tests verifying double newline termination
- `tests/integration/test_streaming_browser.py` — 6 Playwright browser tests (all passing)
- `tests/integration/test_realtime_streaming.py` — 5 SSE API tests (all passing)

## Dashboard Cleanup

Removed temporary debug `console.log` statements and colored status messages that were added during troubleshooting. Kept error logging for network failures.

## Network Issues When Remote

**Status**: ✅ FIXED — All `fetch()` calls in the dashboard now use relative URLs (`/api/v1/...`). The only `localhost` reference is in a fallback catch block for config loading.

## Auth State UI

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
- Header shows login/logout buttons
- Buttons disabled until authenticated
- Login modal functionality works
- `doSchedule()` checks `_qbitAuthenticated`
- `doDownload()` handles `auth_failed` response from backend

## Commit Summary

1. **Fix SSE format**: Added double newline termination per spec
2. **Add SSE format tests**: 3 compliance tests for event formatting
3. **Clean dashboard**: Removed debug console.log statements and temporary status messages
