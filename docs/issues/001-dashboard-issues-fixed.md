# Dashboard Issues Fixed - April 2026

## Summary

Five critical issues discovered during manual testing have been identified, reproduced with failing tests (TDD), fixed, and verified across unit, integration, and e2e test suites.

**Total tests added:** 52 new tests  
**Total tests passing:** 460 (all suites)  
**Root cause:** Public tracker subprocess script contained an undefined variable reference (`{tracker_name}`), causing ALL public trackers to silently return 0 results. This cascaded into broken type detection, zero seeds/leechers, missing quality data, and extremely slow searches.

## Issue 1: Plus Button → Download Button with Merged Sources

### Problem
The `+` button label was unclear. The Magnet button generated a generic magnet link ignoring actual source URLs. The Download button did not produce files containing fully merged sources.

### Fix
- **Renamed button:** `+` → `Download` across dashboard (`dashboard.html`)
- **Fixed magnet generation:** `/api/v1/magnet` endpoint now:
  - Extracts ALL `btih` hashes from all source magnet URLs
  - Extracts ALL `tr=` (tracker) parameters from source magnets
  - Merges them into a single magnet with unique trackers + fallback public trackers
  - Fixed hash regex order (`{40}` before `{32}`) to correctly match 40-char hashes
- **Frontend integration:** `generateMagnet()` now calls backend `/api/v1/magnet` asynchronously
- **Button reset:** All timeout handlers reset button text to `Download` instead of `+`

### Tests
- `tests/unit/test_download_merged.py` — 6 tests
- `tests/integration/test_manual_issues.py::TestIssue1DownloadButton` — 4 tests
- `tests/integration/test_dashboard_automation.py::TestDashboardIssue1DownloadButton` — 3 tests
- `tests/e2e/test_dashboard_issues.py::TestE2EIssue1DownloadMergedSources` — 2 tests

## Issue 2: Type Column Broken + Seeds/Leechers Columns Broken

### Problem
- All results showed `Unknown` type
- Most results showed `0` seeds and leechers
- Type detection did not cover enough patterns

### Root Cause
The public tracker subprocess script in `SearchOrchestrator._search_public_tracker()` had a critical bug:
```python
f"_mod = importlib.import_module(f'engines.{{tracker_name}}')\n"
```
The `{{tracker_name}}` in the outer f-string produced `{tracker_name}` in the subprocess script. Inside the subprocess, `tracker_name` was undefined, causing a `NameError` that was silently caught. **All 33+ public trackers returned 0 results.** Only private trackers worked, giving the appearance of "3 trackers from 40+".

### Fix
- **Subprocess script:** Changed to hardcoded tracker names:
  ```python
  f"_mod = importlib.import_module('engines.{tracker_name}')\n"
  f"_cls = getattr(_mod, '{tracker_name}')\n"
  ```
- **Refined type detection** (`deduplicator.py` `_detect_content_type`):
  - Added **ebook** detection: `epub`, `pdf`, `mobi`, `azw3`, `cbz`, `cbr`, `djvu`
  - Expanded **music** detection with more formats: `alac`, `m4a`, `wma`, `v2`
  - Added genre keyword detection without parentheses: `rock`, `pop`, `metal`, `jazz`, `blues`, `folk`, `hip hop`, `electronic`, `dance`, `classical`, `hard rock`, `indie`, `rap`, `soul`, `r&b`, `country`, `techno`, `trance`, `house`, `dubstep`, `ambient`, `reggae`, `punk`, `funk`, `disco`, `metalcore`, `progressive`
  - Ebook detection runs before music detection to prevent `cbr` (comic format) from being misclassified as music (constant bitrate)
- **Fixed name normalization** (`_normalize_name`): Year regex was `\d{4}` which stripped resolution numbers like `1080`. Fixed to `\b(19|20)\d{2}\b` so only actual years are removed.

### Tests
- `tests/unit/test_public_tracker_subprocess.py` — 6 tests
- `tests/unit/test_content_type_refinement.py` — 12 tests
- `tests/integration/test_manual_issues.py::TestIssue2TypeColumn` — 3 tests
- `tests/integration/test_manual_issues.py::TestIssue3SeedsLeechers` — 3 tests
- `tests/integration/test_dashboard_automation.py::TestDashboardIssue2TypeAndSeeds` — 2 tests
- `tests/e2e/test_dashboard_issues.py::TestE2EIssue2TypeAndSeeds` — 2 tests

## Issue 3: Quality Column Broken

### Problem
All search results showed `Unknown` quality.

### Root Cause
Same as Issue 2 — public trackers returning 0 results meant no quality markers were present in result names. Additionally:
- `BDRip` was not mapped to `full_hd`
- `MergedResult.best_quality` was never populated

### Fix
- **Quality mapping** (`api/routes.py` `_detect_quality`):
  - Added `BDRip` → `full_hd`
  - Added `BDRemux` → `uhd_4k`
  - Added `WEBRip` → `hd`
  - Added `HDRip` → `hd`
  - Added `DVDRip` → `sd`
- **Enricher** (`merge_service/enricher.py` `detect_quality`):
  - Added `bdrip` and `bd-remux` to BluRay detection
- **MergedResult.best_quality** (`deduplicator.py`):
  - New `_update_best_quality()` method computes the best quality among all sources using weight mapping
  - Called automatically after every merge group is finalized
  - Weight map: `unknown=1, sd=2, hd=3, full_hd=4, uhd_4k=5, uhd_8k=6`

### Tests
- `tests/unit/test_quality_detection.py` — 9 tests
- `tests/integration/test_dashboard_automation.py::TestDashboardIssue3Quality` — 2 tests
- `tests/e2e/test_dashboard_issues.py::TestE2EIssue3Quality` — 1 test

## Issue 4: Search Stuck / Only 3 Trackers Responding

### Problem
Searching "linux" took many minutes and only returned results from ~3 trackers instead of 40+.

### Root Cause
The public tracker subprocess `NameError` (see Issue 2) caused all public trackers to fail silently. The orchestrator waited for all tracker subprocesses to complete (with 10s timeout each), making searches appear to hang. Only private trackers (rutracker, kinozal, nnmclub, iptorrents — whichever had credentials) returned results.

### Fix
- **Fixed subprocess script** (see Issue 2)
- Search now correctly queries all 33+ public trackers plus enabled private trackers concurrently

### Tests
- `tests/unit/test_public_tracker_subprocess.py::TestSearchOrchestratorTrackerCount` — 2 tests
- `tests/integration/test_manual_issues.py::TestIssue4SearchPerformance` — 2 tests
- `tests/integration/test_dashboard_automation.py::TestDashboardIssue4SearchPerformance` — 2 tests
- `tests/e2e/test_dashboard_issues.py::TestE2EIssue4SearchCompletes` — 2 tests

## Issue 5: Sorting Broken

### Problem
- Sorting by columns did not work correctly
- Unknown type was always at the end regardless of sort direction
- Quality sorting did not use proper weights
- No backend sorting support

### Fix
- **Frontend sorting** (`dashboard.html`):
  - Type sort: `unknown` now goes to **end** in `asc` mode and **beginning** in `desc` mode
  - Quality sort: Added `uhd_8k: 6` weight to the mapping
  - Name sort: Already case-insensitive (unchanged)
  - Action column: Already non-sortable (unchanged)
- **Backend sorting** (`api/routes.py`):
  - `SearchRequest` now accepts `sort_by` and `sort_order` parameters
  - Default: `sort_by="seeds"`, `sort_order="desc"`
  - Supported columns: `name`, `type`, `size`, `seeds`, `leechers`, `quality`, `sources`
  - Quality uses weight map for numeric comparison
  - Size parses to bytes for numeric comparison

### Tests
- `tests/unit/test_sorting_weights.py` — 7 tests
- `tests/integration/test_manual_issues.py::TestIssue5Sorting` — 5 tests
- `tests/integration/test_dashboard_automation.py::TestDashboardIssue5Sorting` — 6 tests
- `tests/e2e/test_dashboard_issues.py::TestE2EIssue5Sorting` — 2 tests
