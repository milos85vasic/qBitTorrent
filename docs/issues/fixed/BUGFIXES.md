## 2026-04-27 — boba-jackett implementation (plan 2026-04-27-jackett-management-ui-and-system-db.md)

### 1. Master-key two-step write silent data-loss window

**Severity:** HIGH (silent credential loss possible on crash mid-bootstrap).

**Root cause:** Initial implementation of `bootstrap.EnsureMasterKey`
generated `BOBA_MASTER_KEY` in memory, returned it to the caller,
and *then* wrote `.env` in a separate step. If the process crashed,
was killed, or the host lost power between those two operations, the
caller would proceed to encrypt credentials with a key that disk had
no record of — making them permanently undecipherable.

**Affected files:**
- `qBitTorrent-go/internal/bootstrap/bootstrap.go`
- `qBitTorrent-go/internal/envfile/write.go`

**Fix:** Collapse the generate + write into a single
`envfile.Atomic` write (`tmpfile + fsync + rename`) before the
function returns. Caller never sees a key that hasn't been durably
persisted. Commit `c0f20bc`.

**Regression guard:**
- `qBitTorrent-go/internal/bootstrap/bootstrap_test.go::TestEnsureMasterKeyDoesNotDuplicateHeader`
- `qBitTorrent-go/internal/envfile/write_test.go` atomic-write test layer

### 2. SQLite database file mode `0644` (world-readable credentials)

**Severity:** CRITICAL (any local user could read encrypted credentials
+ ciphertext-only attack surface).

**Root cause:** `modernc.org/sqlite` creates database files with the
process's default umask, which on the container yielded `0644`
(world-readable). The Go service's `.env` was already `0600` via
`envfile.Atomic`, but `boba.db` was leaking — a defense-in-depth
breach since the rows are encrypted, but still a violation of the
principle "the DB file should be readable only by the service owner".

**Affected files:**
- `qBitTorrent-go/internal/db/conn.go`

**Fix:** After the first `Open()` succeeds, `db.Open` calls
`os.Chmod(path, 0o600)` (and the `-wal` / `-shm` siblings if present),
collapsing the file mode to owner-only. Commit `8405167`.

**Regression guard:**
- Layer 4 security challenge `challenges/scripts/boba_db_file_perms_challenge.sh`
- `qBitTorrent-go/internal/db/credential_leak_test.go`

---

### 3. `AutoconfigResult` nil slices marshalled as JSON `null`

**Severity:** MEDIUM (silent client-breaking schema drift; UI rendered
"undefined" badges instead of "0 items").

**Root cause:** Go's `json.Marshal` serializes a nil slice as `null`,
not `[]`. When `Autoconfigure()` ran on a fresh DB with no discovered
credentials, the `discovered_credentials`, `configured_now`, and
`already_present` fields all marshalled as `null`. The OpenAPI 3.1
schema declared them as `array`, so clients (including the Angular
dashboard) treated `null` as a contract violation.

**Affected files:**
- `qBitTorrent-go/internal/jackett/autoconfig.go`

**Fix:** Pre-allocate empty slices (`[]string{}`) at the top of
`Autoconfigure()` so a "nothing to do" run still serializes as
`{...,"discovered":[],"configured_now":[],...}`. Commit `6f3dbaf`.

**Regression guard:**
- Layer 6 contract test `qBitTorrent-go/tests/contract/openapi_test.go`
  (validates each named field is `array` per OpenAPI schema even on
  empty runs).

### 4. Catalog `ReplaceAll` empty-input wipe risk

**Severity:** HIGH (would permanently wipe the indexer catalog if
Jackett returned an empty response; UI would show no indexers and
fuzzy matcher would have nothing to match against).

**Root cause:** `repos.IndexerCatalog.ReplaceAll(rows []Row)`
unconditionally `DELETE`d existing rows then `INSERT`ed the new ones.
If `rows` was empty (Jackett momentarily unhealthy, transient 502, or
catalog parse failure), the delete still happened, leaving an empty
catalog table. Next refresh would have nothing to compare against.

**Affected files:**
- `qBitTorrent-go/internal/db/catalog.go` (or equivalent repo file)

**Fix:** Refuse the operation early with
`errors.New("repos: ReplaceAll refusing empty replacement")`. The
caller (autoconfig orchestrator) treats this as a soft error, logs it,
and leaves the previous catalog intact. Commit `8d71df1`.

**Regression guard:**
- `qBitTorrent-go/internal/jackettapi/catalog_test.go::TestRefreshCatalogAllTemplatesFailReturns200WithErrors`

### 5. `TestSearchHandler_QueueFull` pre-existing flake (NOT a boba-jackett bug)

**Severity:** LOW (test-only; flagged for follow-up).

**Status:** **NOT FIXED** in this plan. Confirmed unrelated to
boba-jackett work.

**Location:** `qBitTorrent-go/internal/api/api_test.go`

**Symptom:** Occasional intermittent failure under load when the
search queue fills before the test's `wait` returns.

**Action:** Logged here for traceability so future audits don't
mis-attribute it. Open issue suggestion: stabilise by injecting a
deterministic queue-full hook instead of racing against real
goroutine scheduling.
