# Quality Stack

`docker-compose.quality.yml` is a **separate, opt-in** compose file
holding SonarQube, Prometheus, Grafana, and the one-shot scanner
containers (semgrep/trivy/gitleaks/snyk).

## Why separate from the main `docker-compose.yml`?

The platform constitution (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`
Principle I — Container-First Architecture) defines the product
topology as exactly **two containers**: `qbittorrent` and
`download-proxy`, plus one optional host process (`webui-bridge.py`).
Adding SonarQube, Postgres (for Sonar), Prometheus, Grafana, and four
scanner images would silently extend that topology from 2 → 8
runtime services, which would violate the principle.

Keeping the quality services in a **separate compose file** means:

1. The product is still a two-container deploy. `./start.sh` launches
   only those two.
2. Quality tooling is explicit and scope-limited: `-f
   docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.quality.yml` only when the
   developer wants it.
3. Profiles (`quality`, `run-once`, `observability`, …) gate each
   service so nothing starts by accident.
4. The constitution does not need an amendment for quality tooling,
   since no product service depends on it.

See `docs/SCANNING.md` for scanner usage and `docs/OBSERVABILITY.md`
for the Prometheus/Grafana story.

## Profiles

| Profile | Services | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| `quality` | sonarqube, sonar-db | Continuous quality gate host |
| `sonarqube` | sonarqube, sonar-db | Alias for above |
| `run-once` | semgrep, trivy, gitleaks, snyk | Scheduled / on-demand scans |
| `semgrep`, `trivy`, `gitleaks`, `snyk` | single scanner each | Target one tool |
| `observability` | prometheus, grafana | Metric collection + dashboards |

## Environment variables

```
SONAR_DB_USER=sonar              # default
SONAR_DB_PASSWORD=sonar          # default — override in production
SONAR_TOKEN=…                    # CI upload
SONAR_HOST_URL=http://localhost:9000
SNYK_TOKEN=…                     # optional
GRAFANA_USER=admin               # default
GRAFANA_PASSWORD=admin           # default — override in production
```

## Ports

All quality services bind to `127.0.0.1:` only so they are not exposed
to the LAN:

- `9000` SonarQube UI
- `9090` Prometheus
- `3000` Grafana

## Lifecycle

```bash
# Bring up SonarQube (~2 min cold start)
$COMPOSE_CMD -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.quality.yml \
    --profile sonarqube up -d

# Run observability stack
$COMPOSE_CMD -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.quality.yml \
    --profile observability up -d

# Stop quality services (product stays running)
$COMPOSE_CMD -f docker-compose.quality.yml --profile quality down
```

`./scripts/scan.sh` wraps these lifecycle commands for scanner
one-shots.
