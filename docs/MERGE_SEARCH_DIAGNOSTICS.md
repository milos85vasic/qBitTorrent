# Merge-Search Diagnostics

This document explains how the merge service reports per-tracker failures
so operators can distinguish "nothing wrong, niche board has no hits for
this query" from "upstream is dead" from "plugin is crashing."

Context: prior to 2026-04-23 a search for `linux` returned 137 total
hits and 37 of 40 trackers returned zero with **no explanation**. The
root cause was a monkeypatch targeting the wrong `novaprinter` module
(see commit `e8b904d`), but the deeper problem was visibility:
`TrackerSearchStat.error` was always `None` on empty trackers, so
operators couldn't tell whether an empty chip meant "nothing to see"
or "broken." This doc describes the diagnostic pipeline that
replaces that opacity.

Every public-tracker subprocess runs in isolation in a Python 3.12
process spawned by `_search_public_tracker`
(`download-proxy/src/merge_service/search.py`). Whatever the plugin
writes to stderr is captured after the subprocess exits (or is killed
at the deadline) and passed through `_classify_plugin_stderr` to
produce a structured diagnostic.

### Subprocess lifecycle

1. **Spawn** — `asyncio.create_subprocess_exec(..., start_new_session=True)`
   gives the plugin its own process group so any threads or forked
   workers can be terminated together.

2. **Stream** — stdout is read line-by-line with a per-read timeout.
   Each NDJSON row is parsed as it arrives; partial results are
   preserved even if the deadline fires mid-scrape.

3. **Deadline** — when `PUBLIC_TRACKER_DEADLINE_SECONDS` is reached the
   loop breaks with `killed_by_deadline=True`.

4. **Kill** — `proc.kill()` (SIGKILL to the direct child) followed by
   `os.killpg(os.getpgid(proc.pid), signal.SIGKILL)` (SIGKILL to the
   entire process group). This catches plugins that spawn child
   processes or background threads.

5. **Wait** — `asyncio.wait_for(proc.wait(), timeout=5.0)` waits up to
   5 seconds for the process to actually die. If it doesn't, we log a
   warning and abandon the zombie — the orchestrator must NEVER hang
   waiting for a defunct subprocess.

6. **Stderr** — `asyncio.wait_for(proc.stderr.read(), timeout=5.0)`
   reads stderr with the same 5-second cap. If the pipe is still open
   (zombie), we abandon it and move on.

7. **Backstop** — `_search_tracker` wraps the entire
   `_search_public_tracker` call in an outer
   `asyncio.wait_for(..., deadline+10)` so even if every internal
   cleanup step has a bug, the coroutine always returns.

8. **Gather defence** — `_run_search` uses
   `asyncio.gather(..., return_exceptions=True)` so one tracker
   failing (or hanging) cannot prevent the rest of the fan-out from
   completing.

## Error classes (`error_type`)

| `error_type`             | Meaning                                                    | Operator action              |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| `upstream_http_403`      | Remote tracker returned 403 Forbidden                      | Likely geoblock or CDN WAF. Try VPN. |
| `upstream_http_404`      | Remote tracker returned 404 Not Found                      | Domain moved — update `PUBLIC_TRACKERS` URL |
| `upstream_timeout`       | Remote gateway timed out                                   | Transient — retry or bump `PUBLIC_TRACKER_DEADLINE_SECONDS` |
| `dns_failure`            | Tracker hostname does not resolve                          | Domain is dead — move to `DEAD_PUBLIC_TRACKERS` |
| `tls_failure`            | TLS handshake with upstream failed                         | Cert issue upstream. No action. |
| `upstream_incomplete`    | Upstream closed connection mid-response                    | Transient — retry |
| `plugin_env_missing`     | Plugin needs a file/dir not present in the container       | Check plugin source; add dir to Dockerfile |
| `plugin_parse_failure`   | Plugin regex/JSON parse failed (upstream HTML rotated)     | Patch plugin regex |
| `plugin_crashed`         | Plugin raised an uncategorised exception                   | Read `notes.stderr_tail` for traceback |
| `deadline_timeout`       | Plugin was still running after per-tracker deadline        | Bump deadline or split the work |
| `auth_failure`           | Private tracker login returned no session cookie           | Check credentials in `.env`; may be transient CAPTCHA |
| `upstream_captcha`       | Private tracker served a CAPTCHA page instead of results   | Wait a few minutes and retry; rotate IP if persistent |

When the plugin runs cleanly but doesn't emit any rows, `error_type` is
`None` and `status` stays at `empty`. This is the "genuinely no hits
for this query on this board" path — e.g. searching `linux` on an
anime-only tracker.

## Environment variables

### `PUBLIC_TRACKER_DEADLINE_SECONDS`

Default: `60`. Clamped to `[5, 120]`.

How long each public-tracker subprocess may run before it is
SIGKILLed. Because `_search_public_tracker` streams results as NDJSON
with `sys.stdout.flush()`, partial results are preserved even if the
deadline fires mid-scrape. When that happens,
`TrackerSearchStat.notes["deadline_hit"] = True` and the dashboard
chip shows a stopwatch icon.

Raise this if you have slow upstreams and are willing to wait — but
remember that the orchestrator runs up to
`MAX_CONCURRENT_TRACKERS` fan-out tasks at a time, so wall-clock
latency grows with `deadline × ceil(trackers / max_concurrent)`.

### `ENABLE_DEAD_TRACKERS`

Default: `1` (all trackers exposed; dead ones filtered by
`DEAD_PUBLIC_TRACKERS`).

Public trackers that are empirically known-dead as of 2026-04-23 live
in `DEAD_PUBLIC_TRACKERS` in `search.py` and are excluded from the
fan-out. Set `ENABLE_DEAD_TRACKERS=0` to hide them. Set
`ENABLE_DEAD_TRACKERS=1` (default) to include them for testing
whether an upstream has recovered, or when operating through a
proxy/VPN that bypasses geoblocks.

The known-dead list:

* HTTP 403 (Cloudflare/geoblock): `eztv`, `bt4g`,
  `extratorrent`, `one337x`, `bitru`
* HTTP 404 (site down): `ali213`
* Gateway timeout: `audiobookbay`
* DNS failure (domain dead): `pctorrent`, `yihua`
* TLS failure: `xfsub`
* Plugin crash (site down): none
* API changed: `anilibra` (returns 400 Unknown query)
* Site rebrand/redesign: `solidtorrents` (→ bitsearch.to), `therarbg`
  (new HTML), `gamestorrents` (WordPress redesign), `btsow`
  (JS redirect challenge)
* Upstream dead: `torrentfunk` (HTTP 500)

These plugins are still installed and the classifier still reports
their real reasons when `ENABLE_DEAD_TRACKERS=1`, so it's easy to
spot when an upstream starts working again and move the entry out of
the set.

### `MAX_CONCURRENT_TRACKERS`

Default: `5`. Semaphore-bounded fan-out width. Wall-clock latency is
approximately `deadline × (tracker_count / max_concurrent)` in the
worst case. Lower this on constrained hosts to keep memory bounded.

### `MAX_CONCURRENT_SEARCHES`

Default: `8`. Per-orchestrator cap on the number of in-flight
`_run_search` fan-outs. When saturated, both `POST /api/v1/search`
and `POST /api/v1/search/sync` return HTTP 429 with a
`retry shortly` hint so callers back off rather than piling more
subprocess work on a starving event loop.

Stress tests revealed that without this cap, 50 rapid POSTs would
spawn 50 × 24 = 1200 simultaneous subprocess spawns and even
`/health` stopped responding. With the cap in place the service
remains responsive (at most 8 × 24 = ~200 subprocesses mid-flight,
plus the 5-per-fan-out semaphore actually runs closer to 40).

| Icon      | Meaning                                                      |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `✓ N`     | Success — N results                                          |
| `∅`       | Empty — plugin ran cleanly, found nothing for this query     |
| `⚠`       | Error — hover for `error_type`, click for full dialog        |
| `⏱`       | Deadline hit — results are truncated to whatever flushed      |
| `🔒`      | Authenticated session used                                   |

Click any chip to open the **tracker-stat dialog** which shows the
full `TrackerSearchStat` including `notes.stderr_tail` for crashed
plugins.

## Rebuild / restart contract

`docker-compose.yml` bind-mounts `./download-proxy/` into the
container at `/config/download-proxy`. That means:

* **Python source changes in `download-proxy/src/`** → `podman restart
  qbittorrent-proxy` picks them up; no rebuild needed.
* **Plugin changes in `plugins/`** → `./install-plugin.sh` copies them
  into `./config/qBittorrent/nova3/engines/`, which is also
  bind-mounted; restart again picks them up.
* **`docker-compose.yml` / `start-proxy.sh` / env changes** → `podman
  compose down && podman compose up -d`.

Full rebuild (`podman build`) is only necessary when the base image
(`python:3.12-alpine`) itself needs to change.

## Troubleshooting

**All public trackers return 0.** The subprocess capture is broken.
First thing to check: does the script in `_search_public_tracker`
still do `import novaprinter as _np`? If it says `engines.novaprinter`,
you've reintroduced the 37-empty-trackers bug. See commit `e8b904d`.

**One tracker goes to 0 intermittently.** Look at `tracker_stats[].error`.
If it's consistently `upstream_http_403`, the geoblock probably caught
you; if it bounces between `success` and `upstream_timeout`, the
upstream is rate-limiting.

**`results_count` is capped at some suspicious round number.** Check
`notes.deadline_hit`. If true, raise `PUBLIC_TRACKER_DEADLINE_SECONDS`.

**Search hangs forever — one tracker is stuck in cleanup.** Prior to
2026-04-24 a plugin in an uninterruptible sleep state could deadlock
the entire orchestrator because `stderr.read()` was called before
`proc.wait()`. The fix reordered cleanup, added process-group kills,
and wrapped every blocking call in a 5-second timeout. If you still
see hangs, check the logs for the warning
`"proc.wait() timed out during cleanup — abandoning zombie"`.

**I added a tracker but it never appears in the fan-out.** It's
probably in `DEAD_PUBLIC_TRACKERS`. Move it out, or set
`ENABLE_DEAD_TRACKERS=1` temporarily.
