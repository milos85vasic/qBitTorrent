# Scanning

qBittorrent-Fixed runs **seven scanners** that cover dependencies,
static analysis, secrets, and quality gates. They all run locally
(via `scripts/scan.sh`) and in CI (`.github/workflows/security.yml`).

| Scanner | Surface | Invocation | Runs in |
|---|---|---|---|
| pip-audit | Python runtime deps | host | push, nightly, weekly |
| bandit | Python SAST | host (`pip install 'bandit[toml]'`) | push, weekly |
| ruff | Python lint + ASYNC/S rules | host | every push |
| semgrep | Multi-language SAST (project + registry rules) | compose run-once | weekly, push on source change |
| trivy | FS CVE + misconfig + secret scan | compose run-once | weekly, push on deps |
| gitleaks | Secret scan (git history) | compose run-once | every push |
| snyk | Commercial dep + SAST (needs token) | compose run-once | weekly |
| sonarqube | Quality gate upload (needs token) | sonar-scanner (host) | weekly |

## Local run

```bash
# Run everything — non-interactive, will skip snyk/sonar if tokens are unset
./scripts/scan.sh --all

# Run a subset
./scripts/scan.sh pip-audit bandit ruff

# Compose-based scanners need the quality profile up:
$COMPOSE_CMD -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.quality.yml \
    --profile run-once up --remove-orphans --abort-on-container-exit
```

Reports land in `artifacts/scans/<UTC timestamp>/` as SARIF/JSON. CI
uploads them to the GitHub Security tab.

## Non-interactive invariants

`scripts/scan.sh` **never** prompts, reads stdin, escalates privileges,
or calls `sudo`. `tests/unit/test_scan_script_non_interactive.py`
guards the invariant; the CI `syntax` workflow enforces it.

## Secrets

- `SNYK_TOKEN` — if unset, the snyk container exits 0 with a warning.
- `SONAR_TOKEN` / `SONAR_HOST_URL` — if unset, the sonar upload is skipped.
- `.env` and `.env.*` are gitignored; `.gitleaks.toml` allowlists only
  the constitution-mandated `admin:admin` default.

## Waivers

Any `.snyk` ignore, `.trivyignore` entry, or semgrep inline-disable
**must** carry:

1. Finding ID / CVE / rule ID.
2. Reason.
3. Expiry date (`# expires: YYYY-MM-DD`).

`tests/unit/test_scan_waivers_have_expiry.py` (added in Phase 2) will
fail on anything older than its expiry or missing the reason/expiry
annotation.

## Triage policy

- **Critical** → blocks merge; fix or file CVE-waiver PR same day.
- **High** → blocks release; fix in current sprint.
- **Medium** → tracked in `ISSUES.md`; fixed opportunistically.
- **Low/info** → documented, ignored unless it bleeds into higher.

## Observability hooks

Prometheus + Grafana are part of the same `docker-compose.quality.yml`
file under the `observability` profile. See
[`docs/OBSERVABILITY.md`](OBSERVABILITY.md).
