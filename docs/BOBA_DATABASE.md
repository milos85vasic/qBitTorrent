# Boba System Database

The `boba-jackett` Go service (port `7189`) owns a SQLite system
database at `config/boba.db` (default; override with `BOBA_DB_PATH`).
Sensitive columns are encrypted with `BOBA_MASTER_KEY` (AES-256-GCM).

This document is the canonical reference for the schema, the master
key lifecycle, backup, file permissions, and recovery from corruption.

## 1. Schema reference

Defined in `qBitTorrent-go/internal/db/migrations/001_init.sql`. See
the spec at `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-27-jackett-management-ui-and-system-db-design.md` § 5
for full normative text.

| Table | Purpose | Encrypted columns |
|---|---|---|
| `credentials` | Per-tracker credential bundle. `kind` is `userpass` or `cookie`. Holds `username_enc`, `password_enc`, `cookies_enc` (any combination per `kind`). Tracks `created_at`, `updated_at`, `last_used_at`. | `username_enc`, `password_enc`, `cookies_enc` |
| `indexers` | Local registry of indexers configured at Jackett. Each row points (optionally) at a `credentials` row by `linked_credential_name`. Tracks `enabled_for_search`, `last_jackett_sync_at`, `last_test_status`, `last_test_at`. | none |
| `catalog_cache` | Snapshot of Jackett's indexer catalog (last refresh). UI browse + filter source. `template_fields_json` is the per-indexer config template fetched from Jackett. | none |
| `autoconfig_runs` | Append-only history of every auto-config run. Stores `ran_at`, counts, redacted `result_summary_json`, `errors_json`. Indexed by `ran_at DESC` for the UI runs page. | none (summary is already redacted) |
| `indexer_map_overrides` | Explicit `env_name → indexer_id` map. Highest precedence in the matcher (beats fuzzy matching). | none |
| `schema_migrations` | Schema version tracking; row `1` corresponds to `001_init.sql`. | none |

### Indexes
- `idx_indexers_linked_cred` on `indexers(linked_credential_name)`
- `idx_catalog_cached_at` on `catalog_cache(cached_at)`
- `idx_runs_ran_at` on `autoconfig_runs(ran_at DESC)`

### Pragmas
The DB is opened with WAL journaling, foreign keys on, and busy-timeout
sufficient for the bootstrap import + UI write rate.

## 2. Master key lifecycle

### Auto-generation (canonical path)

`BOBA_MASTER_KEY` is a 32-byte hex AES-256-GCM key. It is generated
**exactly once**, on first boot, by `internal/bootstrap.EnsureMasterKey`
(see `qBitTorrent-go/internal/bootstrap/bootstrap.go`).

`start.sh` also calls an `ensure_boba_master_key` helper as a
belt-and-suspenders so the variable is present in the host's `.env`
even if the container has not yet booted.

The two-step write (key generated in memory, then written to .env) was
collapsed into a single atomic `envfile.Atomic` write at commit
`c0f20bc` to eliminate a silent data-loss window. The regression guard
is `TestEnsureMasterKeyDoesNotDuplicateHeader` in
`qBitTorrent-go/internal/bootstrap/bootstrap_test.go`.

### Manual rotation

To rotate the master key without losing credentials:

```bash
# 1. Stop the service (use the orchestrator, never raw podman/docker)
make boba-jackett-stop   # or your orchestrator's equivalent

# 2. Decrypt all rows with the OLD key, re-encrypt with a NEW key.
#    Use the rotate subcommand:
./bin/boba-jackett rotate-key \
  --db /config/boba.db \
  --old-key "$OLD_KEY" \
  --new-key "$NEW_KEY"

# 3. Atomically update .env (envfile.Atomic uses tmpfile + fsync + rename)
./bin/boba-jackett envfile-replace BOBA_MASTER_KEY "$NEW_KEY"

# 4. Start the service
make boba-jackett-start
```

(Implementation note: a `rotate-key` subcommand is the canonical place
for this operation; if not yet present in the binary, follow the
"loss recovery" path below using `.env` as the source of truth.)

### Loss recovery

There is **no recovery** from `BOBA_MASTER_KEY` loss alone. Encrypted
rows in `credentials` become permanently undecipherable.

The only recovery path: the original `<NAME>_USERNAME` /
`<NAME>_PASSWORD` / `<NAME>_COOKIES` triples in `.env` (or wherever
they were originally entered) are still present. To re-bootstrap:

```bash
# 1. Stop the service
# 2. Move the now-useless DB out of the way
mv config/boba.db config/boba.db.lost
# 3. Generate a new master key (or let bootstrap do it)
sed -i '/^BOBA_MASTER_KEY=/d' .env
# 4. Start the service — bootstrap.EnsureMasterKey will generate a fresh
#    key and re-import credentials from .env into a brand new boba.db.
make boba-jackett-start
```

UI-only edits made after the original bootstrap are NOT recoverable —
they were never written back to `.env`.

## 3. Backup procedure

Two acceptable approaches.

**Cold backup (service stopped):**

```bash
make boba-jackett-stop
cp config/boba.db config/boba.db.bak
cp .env .env.bak
make boba-jackett-start
```

**Hot backup (service running):** use SQLite's online `.backup`:

```bash
sqlite3 config/boba.db ".backup config/boba.db.bak"
cp .env .env.bak
```

`.backup` respects WAL semantics and produces a transactionally
consistent snapshot. **Always back up `boba.db.bak` and `.env.bak`
together** — the DB is useless without the matching master key, and
the master key is useless without the DB.

Both files MUST be stored with mode `0600` (or stricter) on persistent
media; treat them as you would a private SSH key.

## 4. File permissions

Both files MUST be `0600` (owner read/write only):

| File | Enforced by | Code reference |
|---|---|---|
| `config/boba.db` (and `-wal`, `-shm` siblings) | `db.Open` chmods on first open if mode is wider | `qBitTorrent-go/internal/db/conn.go` line ~53 |
| `.env` | `internal/envfile.Atomic` writes with mode `0600` | `qBitTorrent-go/internal/envfile/write.go` |

The Layer 4 security challenge `boba_db_file_perms_challenge.sh` is the
regression guard — it MUST PASS before any release. The corresponding
Go test is `qBitTorrent-go/internal/db/credential_leak_test.go`.

The DB file mode bug (modernc.org/sqlite creating `boba.db` `0644`)
was caught at commit `8405167` and fixed in `db.Open` with
`os.Chmod(path, 0o600)`. See also `docs/issues/fixed/BUGFIXES.md`.

## 5. Recovery from a corrupted DB

If `boba.db` becomes corrupted (truncated, partial writes, foreign-key
violations from manual edits, etc.), the recovery path is:

```bash
# 1. Stop the service (orchestrator)
make boba-jackett-stop

# 2. Move the broken DB aside (DO NOT delete — keep it for forensics)
mv config/boba.db config/boba.db.broken
# Also move WAL/SHM if present
mv config/boba.db-wal config/boba.db-wal.broken 2>/dev/null || true
mv config/boba.db-shm config/boba.db-shm.broken 2>/dev/null || true

# 3. Restart — bootstrap.EnsureMasterKey notices the missing DB,
#    re-creates the schema (migration 001), then re-imports any
#    credentials still present in .env.
make boba-jackett-start

# 4. Verify
curl -s http://localhost:7189/healthz | jq .
curl -s http://localhost:7189/api/v1/credentials | jq 'length'
```

Anything entered via the UI after the original bootstrap and before
the corruption is unrecoverable from `.env` alone — see § 2 "Loss
recovery". Always pair regular backups (§ 3) with this recovery path.
