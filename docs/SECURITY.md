# Security

This document defines the threat model, credential-handling rules, and
scanner stack for qBittorrent-Fixed. It complements the constitution
(`.specify/memory/constitution.md`, Principle III — Credential &
Secret Security, and Principle VIII — IPTorrents Freeleech Policy).

## Threat model

| Actor | Asset at risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Public internet | WebUI on :7185 | Bound to host network; constitution III mandates credential change before exposing beyond LAN. Reverse-proxy with basic auth or VPN is the operator's responsibility. |
| Local users on host | `.env`, `~/.qbit.env` | File-system ACLs; `.env` is `rw-------`. Gitleaks in CI catches leaked commits. |
| Malicious plugin | Merge service process | Plugins run in a subprocess with a 10-second timeout. A crashing plugin cannot crash the orchestrator. Phase 2 moves to `ProcessPoolExecutor` with resource limits. |
| Credential capture in logs | Tracker username/password/cookies | Logger never formats credentials; env vars are read directly, never serialised to logs. |
| CSRF / XSS against WebUI | qBittorrent WebUI (admin/admin) | Known-issue: WebUI credentials are hardcoded `admin`/`admin` per constitution III. Operator **must** change on first deploy and not expose the service publicly. |
| Stolen SSE stream | Live search results on :7187 | `/api/v1/search/stream` requires the search_id returned by POST (unguessable UUID); an attacker still needs to race the search initiator. Phase 3 adds per-client bearer tokens. |
| Downgrade / replay | Tracker cookies in session storage | In-memory dict `_tracker_sessions`; cookies never persisted to disk. Phase 2.3 adds **Fernet-at-rest** encryption for saved cookies — status: **pending**. |
| Supply-chain | Python / Node.js / container deps | Dependency audit + SAST + secret scan via the seven-scanner stack (`docs/SCANNING.md`). |

## Credential storage

- **Env vars only.** No credential lands in `config/` that is not
  immediately re-readable from the environment.
- **Priority order** (highest first): shell env → `./.env` →
  `~/.qbit.env` → container env block. Later sources do *not* override
  earlier ones.
- **qBittorrent WebUI login** is saved to
  `config/download-proxy/qbittorrent_creds.json` when the user checks
  "Remember me". The file is `rw-------` and gitignored.
- **Tracker sessions** (`_tracker_sessions` dict in
  `download-proxy/src/merge_service/search.py`) are in-memory. They
  evaporate on container restart. Phase 2.3 will persist them
  encrypted with Fernet — the spec is written but the implementation
  is **pending**.

## `admin`/`admin` default

Per constitution Principle III, the WebUI and the proxy default to
`admin`/`admin` so fresh deploys are immediately usable on a trusted
LAN. This is **intentional** and documented. The project's
`.gitleaks.toml` allowlists the literal `admin:admin` pair so the
secret scanner does not fire on documentation that shows it.

**Mitigation when exposing the service beyond LAN:**

1. Run `init-qbit-password.sh` to set a strong qBittorrent password.
2. Update `.env` with `QBITTORRENT_USER` / `QBITTORRENT_PASS`.
3. Rebuild-reboot (CLAUDE.md mandate).
4. Front the stack with a reverse proxy requiring its own auth.

## Allowed origins

The FastAPI app currently sets:

```python
CORSMiddleware(allow_origins=["*"])
```

at `download-proxy/src/api/__init__.py:68`. This is knowingly
over-permissive to ease local development. Phase 3 of the
completion-initiative plan tightens it to a configurable allowlist
driven by the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` env var (comma-separated).

## CAPTCHA handling

RuTracker periodically presents a CAPTCHA on login. The merge service
proxies it through the `/api/v1/auth/rutracker/*` endpoints in
`download-proxy/src/api/auth.py`:

- `GET /auth/rutracker/status` — returns whether a session cookie
  exists.
- `GET /auth/rutracker/captcha` — fetches the current CAPTCHA image
  from RuTracker, stores the challenge under a random token in the
  in-memory `_pending_captchas` dict, returns the image as base64 with
  the token.
- `POST /auth/rutracker/login` — user submits the token + the decoded
  text; the service replays the login.
- `POST /auth/rutracker/cookie` — user pastes a browser cookie
  directly (bypasses CAPTCHA for headless operation).

Pending challenges live in `_pending_captchas` with no TTL — Phase 3
replaces this with a TTL cache to prevent memory growth.

## IPTorrents freeleech policy (constitution VIII)

Automated tests and downloads MUST only use IPTorrents results flagged
`freeleech`. A freeleech result is displayed as
`IPTorrents [free]` in the tracker-display field of `SearchResult`.
Non-freeleech downloads **cost ratio** and are never triggered by
automation.

Enforcement:

- `download-proxy/src/merge_service/search.py::_parse_iptorrents_html`
  detects `class="free"` and sets `SearchResult.freeleech = True`.
- The deduplicator refuses to merge non-freeleech IPTorrents results
  with results from other trackers
  (`download-proxy/src/merge_service/deduplicator.py`).
- `tests/unit/test_freeleech.py` guards the rules.

## Scanner stack

Seven scanners cover dependencies, SAST, secrets, and quality. Details
in [`SCANNING.md`](SCANNING.md):

- `pip-audit` — Python runtime deps.
- `bandit` — Python SAST.
- `ruff` — lint + async/security rules.
- `semgrep` — multi-language SAST.
- `trivy` — filesystem CVE + misconfig + secret.
- `gitleaks` — git-history secret scan.
- `snyk` — commercial dep + SAST (needs token).
- `sonarqube` — quality gate upload (via opt-in compose).

All run locally via `scripts/scan.sh` and in CI
(`.github/workflows/security.yml`). Reports land under
`artifacts/scans/<UTC timestamp>/`.

## Waiver policy

Any `.snyk` ignore, `.trivyignore` entry, or semgrep inline-disable
**must** carry:

1. Finding ID / CVE / rule ID.
2. Reason.
3. Expiry date (`# expires: YYYY-MM-DD`).

Phase 2 introduces `tests/unit/test_scan_waivers_have_expiry.py` which
will fail on anything older than its expiry or missing the reason
annotation.

## Triage SLOs

- **Critical** — blocks merge; same-day fix or file a CVE-waiver PR.
- **High** — blocks release; fix in current sprint.
- **Medium** — tracked in `ISSUES.md`; opportunistic.
- **Low / info** — documented, ignored unless it bleeds into higher.

## Known gaps (pending)

- Fernet-at-rest for tracker cookies — Phase 2.3.
- Allowed-origin allowlist — Phase 3.
- TTL on `_pending_captchas` — Phase 3.
- Bearer-token per-client SSE — Phase 3.
- Per-subprocess resource limit (ulimit, prlimit) for plugin
  execution — Phase 2.
