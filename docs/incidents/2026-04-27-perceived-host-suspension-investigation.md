# 2026-04-27 — "Perceived host suspension" investigation

## TL;DR

User reported the host appeared to suspend / log out / hibernate during a long
work session. **Systematic investigation found no evidence of any host-level
power transition.** The host has been continuously up for 7h08m at the time of
investigation, single user session unbroken since 15:42, all CONST-033
hardening intact, zero `will suspend` broadcasts since the 2026-04-26 fix.

The most likely actual experience: **GUI screen lock / display blank** (an
X11/GNOME-shell layer behavior NOT subject to systemd power-management), OR a
brief GUI freeze caused by a foreign podman container hitting its own 1 GB
memory cgroup limit and OOM-killing its workers — which is exactly what the
container's own resource limit is designed to do (containment, not host
impact).

**No code we wrote contributed.** The CONST-033 source-tree challenge passes;
nothing in this project invokes any forbidden host-power call directly or
indirectly.

## Triple-check evidence

### 1. Source-tree clean (CONST-033 layer 5)

```
$ bash challenges/scripts/no_suspend_calls_challenge.sh
=== no_suspend_calls_challenge ===
Scanner: scripts/host-power-management/check-no-suspend-calls.sh
Root:    /run/media/milosvasic/DATA4TB/Projects/Boba
OK: no forbidden host-power-management calls
=== summary: PASS ===
```

### 2. Host hardened (CONST-033 layer 4)

```
$ bash challenges/scripts/host_no_auto_suspend_challenge.sh
[1/4] sleep / suspend / hibernate / hybrid-sleep targets masked? PASS
[2/4] AllowSuspend=no in sleep.conf or drop-in?                  PASS
[3/4] logind IdleAction safe? (IdleAction=ignore)                 PASS
[4/4] 'will suspend' broadcasts since 2026-04-26 fix:    0       PASS
=== summary: 4 pass, 0 fail ===
```

### 3. No host-level suspend / shutdown / reboot occurred

```
$ uptime
 22:50:55 up  7:08,  1 user,  load average: 0.62, 0.87, 2.01
```

7h08m continuous uptime — no suspend, no resume, no reboot since the workday
started. The reported "stuck or suspended" perception is incompatible with the
host's actual state.

### 4. No user session terminated

```
$ journalctl --user --since today | grep -iE "logout|terminated|signed|session.*close"
# only su (root) sessions closing — milosvasic session unbroken since 15:42 login
```

### 5. Memory state currently healthy

```
$ free -h
               total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:            62Gi        11Gi       3.0Gi       4.7Gi        53Gi        51Gi
Swap:           15Gi       361Mi        15Gi

$ cat /proc/pressure/memory
some avg10=0.01 avg60=0.03 avg300=0.00 total=102743908
```

51 GiB available, ~zero memory pressure. Nothing approaching OOM territory at
the host level.

### 6. The one OOM event found

```
$ journalctl -k --since "24 hours ago" | grep -iE "oom|killed process"
Apr 27 21:41:35 nezha kernel: oom-kill:constraint=CONSTRAINT_MEMCG, ...
  oom_memcg=/user.slice/user-1000.slice/user@1000.service/user.slice/
            user-libpod_pod_41847d97.../libpod-d2fcb8aa.../scope
Apr 27 21:41:35 nezha kernel: Memory cgroup out of memory: Killed process
  598707 (python3) total-vm:1108616kB anon-rss:70736kB ... oom_score_adj:200
Apr 27 21:41:35 nezha kernel: memory: usage 1048568kB, limit 1048576kB
```

Decoded:
- A **container** (libpod-d2fcb8aa...) inside a **pod** (libpod_pod_41847d97...)
  hit its own **1048576 kB = 1 GB cgroup memory limit**.
- The kernel killed the container's `python3` worker (oom_score_adj=200, well
  above any host process).
- This is **exactly the design intent of cgroup memory limits** — contain the
  blast radius to the container's own slice. Host memory remained healthy.
- The hash `d2fcb8aa...` does not match any container we created in this
  Boba session. `podman inspect d2fcb8aa9aa7` reports "no such object" — the
  OOM-killed container has been GC'd. The pod hash `41847d97...` likewise
  doesn't appear in `podman pod ps -a`.
- Most likely owner: a foreign project's container (the host runs many: 364
  podman images, 25 containers across `helixgitpx_*`, `helixflow-*`,
  `proxy-*`, `lava-*`, `metube-*`, etc.) — NOT this Boba project.

### 7. Boba project's own podman footprint

```
$ podman images localhost/boba-jackett
REPOSITORY              TAG   IMAGE ID      CREATED      SIZE
localhost/boba-jackett  dev   51d69d8198a1  About 1h ago 22.8 MB

$ podman ps -a | grep -iE "boba|jackett"
jackett        lscr.io/linuxserver/jackett:latest    Exited
boba-jackett   localhost/boba_boba-jackett:latest    Exited
```

Both Boba containers are STOPPED. Our Dockerfile.jackett-built image is 22.8
MB (modernc/sqlite pure-Go, no CGO). Compose-defined limits (`mem_limit:
256m`, `pids_limit: 256`, `oom_score_adj: 500`) ensure that even if our
container OOMs, it dies BEFORE other workloads.

## Root cause: most likely

Three candidate explanations for the user's experience, ranked by evidence:

1. **GNOME / X11 screen lock or display blank.** Not a host suspend; a
   different layer entirely. CONST-033 covers systemd power targets but does
   NOT cover gsettings session locking. The session would appear "frozen"
   when really it just blanked the display. Coming back to it = "did it sleep?"
   Verifiable via `gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.session idle-delay` and
   `gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.screensaver lock-enabled` — out of scope
   for the project's CONST-033 ban (those settings don't change power state),
   but worth user-side audit for ergonomics.

2. **GNOME shell briefly unresponsive while the foreign podman container
   reached its OOM cap.** The `Mullvad VPN` "Frame has assigned frame counter
   but no frame drawn time" warnings at 22:33:13 in gnome-shell logs hint at
   compositor stalls around the same era. Brief stalls can present as
   "the screen froze for a moment".

3. **Some foreign automation hit a memory ceiling.** The OOM-killed
   container is from another project. No code in this Boba session can
   create a container in someone else's pod hash.

**No evidence supports** an actual host suspend, hibernate, or session logout.

## Could podman / docker themselves cause host suspension?

Investigated:
- **Rootless podman** (used here): runs entirely in user-mode. No systemd
  power-management interaction. The OOM-killer respects cgroup memory limits
  and kills containers, NOT the host or the user session.
- **Docker daemon** (not used here): runs as root via systemd. Docker has
  never been observed to invoke power transitions; no upstream code path
  exists for it.
- **systemd-oomd** (not enabled on this host — `systemd-oomd` user unit
  reports `No entries`): if enabled on a future host, it CAN kill entire
  cgroup slices including the user@1000 slice when system-wide pressure
  exceeds thresholds. That presents as a logout from the user's perspective.
  Mitigation: keep memory/pids limits on EVERY container, set `oom_score_adj`
  on long-running containers to be killed BEFORE the user session.

**Verdict:** podman on this host is safe by default. The cgroup OOM event
proved containment worked (foreign container killed; host + user session
unaffected).

## Recurrence prevention (defense in depth)

1. **Container hygiene.** Every podman service in `docker-compose.yml`
   already has `mem_limit`, `pids_limit`, `oom_score_adj: 500` — confirmed
   present on the new `boba-jackett` service from Task 24. Continue this
   pattern for every new service.

2. **Resource limits on test runs (CONST-09).** Already enforced:
   `GOMAXPROCS=2 nice -n 19 ionice -c 3` on every `go test` invocation.

3. **Background process cleanup.** Always `kill` smoke-test binaries
   explicitly before claiming a task complete. Lingering background
   processes from prior smoke tests are themselves a memory-pressure source.
   Discovered one such leak this session (a Task-22 smoke binary left
   running on :7189) — cleaned up.

4. **Periodic podman GC.** Disk usage shows 176 GB in
   `~/.local/share/containers`, with 25 stopped containers and 39 GB
   reclaimable. A `podman system prune -a --volumes` should be a periodic
   user-level maintenance task. NOT something this project automates
   (cross-project blast radius), but worth flagging in CLAUDE.md.

5. **GUI screen-lock / display-blank policy** (user-environment tier,
   not project-tier): if the user wants no display blanking either,
   `gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.session idle-delay 0` and similar.
   Out of scope for this project's constitutional rules but worth a
   user-side toggle if the experience repeats.

## Doctrine added (this commit)

The investigation findings are codified in:
- `CONSTITUTION.md` § "CONST-033 Operational Note — Distinguishing Host
  Suspension from Adjacent Phenomena"
- `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` — short cross-references to the operational
  note + reminder to triple-check before assuming we caused a perceived
  power event.

## Container clean-rebuild action taken

Per user request, after the investigation:
- Stopped Boba's `boba-jackett` and `jackett` containers.
- Removed our locally-built `localhost/boba-jackett:dev` image AND
  the compose-built `localhost/boba_boba-jackett:latest` image.
- Will rebuild via `./start.sh -p` cycle when the user starts the stack
  next (per the project's "no manual container commands" CONST rule —
  the orchestrator brings everything up).

## Status

- ✅ No host suspend / hibernate / logout occurred.
- ✅ No code we shipped contributes any direct or indirect risk of host
  power transition.
- ✅ Both CONST-033 challenges PASS (source-tree + host-state).
- ✅ Foreign OOM event was contained at the cgroup boundary as designed.
- ✅ Doctrine codified for future incident triage.
