# Observability

The Prometheus + Grafana stack lives in `docker-compose.quality.yml`
under the `observability` profile. It is **opt-in** and does not run
as part of the product's two-container topology (constitution
Principle I — see [`QUALITY_STACK.md`](QUALITY_STACK.md) for the
rationale).

## Stack

```
prometheus          image: prom/prometheus:latest
                    profile: observability
                    port: 127.0.0.1:9090 (UI + scrape)
                    retention: 7 days
                    config: observability/prometheus.yml

grafana             image: grafana/grafana-oss:latest
                    profile: observability
                    port: 127.0.0.1:3000
                    dashboards: observability/dashboards/
                    datasources: observability/datasources/
                    default auth: admin / ${GRAFANA_PASSWORD:-admin}
```

Both bind to `127.0.0.1` only — not exposed to the LAN by default.

## Starting the stack

```bash
# Bring the stack up alongside the product
$COMPOSE_CMD -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.quality.yml \
             --profile observability up -d

# Stop only the observability services (product stays running)
$COMPOSE_CMD -f docker-compose.quality.yml \
             --profile observability down
```

`$COMPOSE_CMD` is the runtime-detected binary (`podman compose` /
`docker compose`) — see `start.sh` for the detection logic.

## Viewing dashboards

1. Start the stack as above.
2. Browse to http://127.0.0.1:3000.
3. Log in with `admin` / `admin` (or the value of `GRAFANA_PASSWORD`).
4. Open the pre-provisioned **"Merge Search Service"** dashboard
   (UID: `qbit-merge-search`, source:
   `observability/dashboards/merge-search.json`).

Dashboards are auto-provisioned via
`observability/dashboards/default.yml` and re-read on restart.

## Metric names

The merge service exposes Prometheus metrics at
`GET /metrics` on port 7187 (Phase 6 wires the scrape config — until
then the Grafana dashboard charts a static sample). Names:

| Metric | Type | Labels | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `qbit_merge_active_searches` | gauge | — | Searches currently running through the orchestrator |
| `qbit_merge_tracker_requests_total` | counter | `tracker`, `outcome` | Per-tracker request counter, outcome ∈ {success, error, timeout} |
| `qbit_merge_search_duration_seconds_bucket` | histogram | — | End-to-end search latency distribution |
| `qbit_merge_circuit_breaker_state` | gauge | `tracker` | Circuit-breaker state per tracker; 0=closed, 1=half-open, 2=open |

The pre-provisioned dashboard panels:

1. **Active searches** (stat) — `qbit_merge_active_searches`
2. **Tracker requests per second** (timeseries) —
   `rate(qbit_merge_tracker_requests_total[1m])` legend
   `{{tracker}}`
3. **Search duration p95** (timeseries) —
   `histogram_quantile(0.95, sum by (le)(rate(qbit_merge_search_duration_seconds_bucket[5m])))`
4. **Circuit breakers** (stat grid) —
   `qbit_merge_circuit_breaker_state` grouped by `tracker`

Inspect `observability/dashboards/merge-search.json` for the full
panel definitions.

## Prometheus scrape config

`observability/prometheus.yml` declares the merge service as a scrape
target at `localhost:7187/metrics`. Scrape interval: 15 s.

## How tests assert metric existence

`tests/observability/` (pending Phase 6) asserts:

1. `GET /metrics` returns 200 with `text/plain; version=0.0.4`.
2. Every metric name in the table above appears in the response body.
3. The `/metrics` endpoint is NOT CORS-exposed (should 403 from a
   different origin).
4. Scraping the metric while a search is in flight shows
   `qbit_merge_active_searches > 0`.

Until Phase 6 lands the tests directory is empty and the observability
stack runs against a stub.

## OpenTelemetry

**Pending.** The plan introduces OpenTelemetry tracing that exports to
the Grafana Tempo datasource. Status: not yet implemented.

## Logging

`download-proxy/src/main.py` configures the Python stdlib logger:

```python
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO,
                    format="%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s")
```

No structured logging framework today. Phase 6 target: switch to
`structlog` with JSON output for ingestion by Loki.

## Healthchecks

Separate from metrics but operationally relevant:

| Service | Endpoint | Interval |
|---|---|---|
| `qbittorrent` | `curl -sf http://localhost:7185/` | 30 s |
| `qbittorrent-proxy` | `curl -sf http://localhost:7186/` | 30 s |
| Merge service | `GET http://localhost:7187/health` | fixture-gated |
| `webui-bridge.py` | `GET http://localhost:7188/health` | fixture-gated |

Integration tests rely on these (see
`tests/fixtures/services.py`).

## Gotchas

- Prometheus retention is **7 days**. Longer history requires an
  upstream like Thanos or Mimir.
- Grafana dashboards read from `./observability/dashboards/` — edit
  the JSON in-place and restart Grafana to pick up changes.
- If `GRAFANA_PASSWORD` / `SONAR_DB_PASSWORD` / `SNYK_TOKEN` are unset,
  the quality compose file still comes up but the relevant service
  either uses its default ("admin") or skips (snyk container exits
  0).
- Tests that assert `qbit_merge_active_searches > 0` must hold a
  reference to the in-flight search so it does not complete before the
  assertion.
