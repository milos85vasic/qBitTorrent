# Performance

This document is the reference for performance testing, load testing,
stress testing, and the target service-level objectives (SLOs) for the
merge service.

## Test suites

### pytest-benchmark (latency, microbench)

Directory: `tests/benchmark/`

| File | Under test | Micro-metric |
|---|---|---|
| `test_search_benchmark.py` | `SearchOrchestrator.search` end-to-end | wall clock per call |
| `test_deduplication_benchmark.py` | `Deduplicator.merge_results` on synthetic result sets | wall clock + per-op rate |

Invocation:

```bash
pytest tests/benchmark/ --benchmark-only -v
# Comparing against a saved baseline:
pytest tests/benchmark/ --benchmark-compare
```

Output lands in `.benchmarks/` per pytest-benchmark's default layout
and is uploaded by the nightly CI workflow.

### Performance suite (concurrent behaviour)

Directory: `tests/performance/`

| File | Scenario |
|---|---|
| `test_concurrent_search.py` | 5–20 concurrent searches against the live stack; asserts no deadlocks, no result corruption, latency under the gate |

Invocation:

```bash
pytest tests/performance/ -v --import-mode=importlib
```

### Locust load profile

Directory: `tests/load/` — **pending Phase 6.**

Planned user profiles:

| Profile | Users | Spawn rate | Think time | Target endpoint |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `browser_user` | 50 | 1/s | 2–5 s | `POST /search`, then SSE stream |
| `api_user` | 50 | 2/s | 0 s | `POST /search`, `GET /search/{id}` |

Invocation once the suite exists:

```bash
locust -f tests/load/locustfile.py \
       --host http://localhost:7187 \
       --users 100 --spawn-rate 5 \
       --run-time 10m --headless
```

Results land in `artifacts/load/<timestamp>/`.

### Stress suite

Directory: `tests/stress/`

| File | Scenario |
|---|---|
| `test_search_stress.py` | Sustained 100–1000 VU load; asserts graceful degradation and recovery |

Invocation:

```bash
pytest tests/stress/ -v --import-mode=importlib
```

## Target SLOs

These come from the completion-initiative plan (Part D, Phase 6) and
are the acceptance criteria for the service once Phase 6 ships.

| SLO | Target | Measured by |
|---|---|---|
| p50 search latency at 10 VU | < 500 ms | `tests/performance/test_concurrent_search.py` |
| p95 search latency at 100 VU | **< 2000 ms** | Locust (`tests/load/`) |
| Error rate at 100 VU | < 0.1 % | Locust |
| Graceful degradation at 1000 VU | no 5xx cascade; 429 or 503 returned | `tests/stress/` + chaos probes |
| Recovery after chaos fault | **< 60 s** to resume p95 target | `tests/stress/` + toxiproxy (`tests/chaos/`, pending) |
| SSE connection stability | > 95 % of streams complete | `tests/integration/test_realtime_streaming.py` |
| Deduplicator throughput | > 10 000 results/sec | `tests/benchmark/test_deduplication_benchmark.py` |

## Instrumentation

`tests/instrumentation/` is reserved for cross-cutting perf
instrumentation helpers (timers, scrape utilities). Empty today.

## Metric sources

The p95 and recovery SLOs are measured from Prometheus:

```
# p95 search duration
histogram_quantile(
  0.95,
  sum by (le) (rate(qbit_merge_search_duration_seconds_bucket[5m]))
)

# Active-searches recovery
qbit_merge_active_searches
```

See [`OBSERVABILITY.md`](OBSERVABILITY.md).

## CI integration

- `nightly.yml` runs the benchmark suite and uploads the JSON to
  artifacts.
- A regression gate is **pending** — Phase 6 wires pytest-benchmark's
  `--benchmark-compare-fail=mean:10%` so a 10 % regression fails the
  build.

## Gotchas

- The `pytest-timeout` global 30-second cap applies to benchmark tests
  unless they declare `@pytest.mark.timeout(300)`. Long-running stress
  tests will time out silently otherwise.
- Locust users reuse HTTP connections by default; set
  `LOCUST_ENABLE_CONN_POOLING=0` to force a fresh connection per
  request when reproducing session-handling bugs.
- When running against a live stack on the same host, CPU contention
  between the locust workers and the merge service skews p95. Prefer
  a two-host setup or constrain locust with `taskset`.
- Chaos probes (toxiproxy) require the `tests/chaos/` suite which is
  pending — stress runs today only simulate load, not network faults.
