# Constitution Addendum: Quality Stack (Principle I Exception)

## Principle I — Container-First

> Every service runs in a container. No exceptions.

The quality stack (`docker-compose.quality.yml`) is an **opt-in additive compose file**, not part of the mandatory two-container product topology. It is governed by Principle I but does not alter the product's runtime contract.

## Justification

### Why This Is an Exception

The main `docker-compose.yml` defines exactly two containers (qbittorrent, qbittorrent-proxy) with `network_mode: host`. Adding SonarQube, PostgreSQL, and scanner containers to that file would:

1. Violate the product's minimal runtime topology
2. Require resources (2 GB+ RAM for SonarQube) that development machines may not have
3. Conflate CI/quality tooling with production services

### Why It Complies with Principle I

All quality services **are** containerized. The additive compose pattern (`-f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.quality.yml`) preserves the base topology while allowing on-demand quality infrastructure. No quality service is installed on bare metal.

### Trade-offs Accepted

| Concern | Mitigation |
|---------|------------|
| SonarQube PostgreSQL credentials default to `sonar`/`sonar` | Quality stack never exposed externally; bound to `127.0.0.1` |
| Scanner containers use host network | Matches project convention; scanners are run-to-completion, not long-lived |
| Additional compose file increases surface area | Profiles (`run-once`, `quality`) keep services off by default |

## Services Covered

- **sonarqube**: Code quality platform (community edition)
- **sonar-db**: PostgreSQL 16 for SonarQube persistence
- **snyk**: Dependency vulnerability scanner (requires `SNYK_TOKEN`)
- **semgrep**: Static analysis with SARIF output
- **trivy**: Filesystem vulnerability and misconfiguration scanner
- **gitleaks**: Secret detection in git history

## Activation

```bash
$COMPOSE_CMD -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.quality.yml up -d sonarqube
./scripts/scan.sh --all
```

## Decision Record

- **Date**: 2026-04-22
- **Decision**: Additive compose file for quality tooling, activated via profiles
- **Alternatives considered**: (1) Separate repo — rejected, splits codebase; (2) CI-only — rejected, developers need local access; (3) Bare-metal tools — rejected, violates Principle I

## Principles Compliance Check (Phase 10 Verification)

| Principle | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| I — Container-First | **Compliant** | All quality services containerized in additive compose; product topology unchanged (2 containers) |
| II — Manual CI | **Compliant** | `./ci.sh` remains the canonical CI entry point; GitHub Actions workflows are supplementary |
| III — No secrets in repo | **Compliant** | `.env` gitignored; `CredentialScrubber` filter active; Gitleaks scanner configured |
| IV — WebUI credentials | **Compliant** | `admin`/`admin` hardcoded and unchanged |
| V — Freeleech-only testing | **Compliant** | IPTorrents tests use `[free]` tagged results only |
| VI — TDD | **Compliant** | 1,118 unit tests passing; coverage gate at 49% |

**Last verified**: 2026-04-22 (Phase 10 final verification)
